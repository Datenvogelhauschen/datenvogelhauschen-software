# üïäÔ∏è Datenvogelh√§uschen
A digital effort to protect our local fauna using data analysis. 
This project was created as part of the [VDE Technikpreis 2021](https://www.vde-rhein-ruhr.de/de/youngnet-regional/schule-mint/technikpreis).


## üè† Getting yourself a Datenvogelh√§uschen
### Ordering the Datenvogelh√§uschen
The Datenvogelh√§uschen isn't a commercial product by now. But if you are interested in one and don't
feel like building it yourself, you can feel free to contact us and get a Datenvogelh√§uschen for the price
of materials and shipping.

### Building the Datenvogelh√§uschen
#### Hardware
! TODO !

#### Software
##### Running a released version


##### Building the software on your own
Running the Datenvogelh√§uschen software is simple. SSH on your Raspberry Pi and clone this repository via:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jbohnst/datenvogelhauschen-software.git
```

Then `cd` into the `datenvogelhauschen-software/` directory and install the required node and system packages:

```shell
# Install system packages
# If you want to export data to another filesystem than NTFS or ext4, you can add the according packages here.
# Be aware that some filesystems like Fat32 will not work by their nature.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g pigpio graphicsmagick nodejs npm ttf-mscorefonts-installer python3

# Install the Datenvogelh√§uschen npm package requirements
$ npm install
```

Now, as the `bmp280` package contains a typo, you'll need to go into the `node_modules/`
directory to rename `I2cBus` to `I2CBus` in `@idenisovs/bmp280/types/index.d.ts`. This will
likely not be needed to be done anymore in the future. For now, we'll work arond this issue like this.

Now that you've installed the `datenvogelhauschen` node package, you can build it by typing:

```shell
# This software needs to run as root to be able to make use of all features
$ npm run build --versionMajor=0 --versionMinor=0

# Or, if this doesn't work because of permissions:
$ npm run build && sudo $(which node) ./dist/index.js
```

The TypeScript scripts will be compiled and the software will be executed. Open `http://raspberrypi/`
(or whatever device name you may choose) in your browser to configure your Datenvogelh√§uschen.

And don't forget to create a systemd service if you want the Datenvogelh√§uschen software to run
automatically on startup. This is helpful in case of power shortages.
